## Lore

”Should a painboy have gone rummaging about in a bunch of Ork skulls, seeking to create the perfect Kommandos? Probably not. Did he do it anyway? Of course.”

Painboy Waznag was an ork of vision they said. Did he know what he was doing? Nope. Was he utterly mad? Without a doubt! But such trivial quirks dos not stop an ork on his path to greatness.

By testing and mutilated dozens of orks brains, Waznag accidentally managed to create a mutated branch of Ork kommanos. At first he though them un-Orkish, as the lacked the usual fondneess for raucous humour and brutish violence. When they tore through his lab, and pain boy interns he saw them for what they really where: Cold, cruel, and unsettlingly ruthless. Who would have thought that pheremone glands of a stalker squid would fit so well with an ork brain? He dubbed them “Da Snazzy Boyz!”

### WAAAGH OGLUK!

When Waaagh Ogluk attacked the forge world of Egdyzian Da snazzy boyz was sent in advance, acting as vanguards, to soften the planetary defence, and pave the way for Ogluks invasion. 

Descending with the fury of Gork and Mork, hundred of droppods made it planetfall, landing on several strategic locations...But there was a flaw in Waznag's visions. Being stuck in a pod for an hour, waiting for battle, can drive any ork mad. When that ork is also infested with a Squig gland, well, its not a pretty sight. 

Imagine the baffled mechanicus as they hastily approached the pods, preparing for an onslaught, only to find each pod filled with the blood and gore of its would-be assailants. 

The defence systems was never taken out and Waaagh Ogluk never made it within the atmosphere .. Waznag never saw his greatest creation in action...

Little did anyone notice the few orks that snuck off to fulfil their mission. 
Those few, rare Snazzy Boyz, that had managed to maintain their sanity

### EGDYSIAN			

Being the last remnants of Waaagh Ogluk, ”Da snazzy boys” continue their holy mission of decimation, not knowing that the Waaagh was shot out of the sky before it ever made planet fall. To them, the Waaagh is still ongoing and “ Da boss is just on his way”
