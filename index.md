Forgeworld Egdysian has been engulfed in a heretical rebellion. With the Adeptus Mechanicus and the forces of the Imperium spilling rebel blood to keep up production, sinister forces gather to intervene...

## Recent skirmishes

### A vengeance forged in blood
Belligerents: **The Forge of Days** vs Da Snazzy Boyz

Having found an easy target, Da Boyz seek to krump the Forge supply lines in preparation for the coming Waagh! But this time the Forge comes prepared, with a mind to regain their favor in the eyes of the Dark Gods.

### Slaughter in Tungsten Valley
Belligerents: The Forge of Days vs **Da Snazzy Boyz**

Mission: Ambush (Octarius)

Da Boyz need more bombs for Da Red Orktober. Their intelligence indicates that the Forge of Days recently recovered a fusion core, and are going to take it from them, or at least get a good fight out of it.

### Aetheric siege
Belligerents: Hunter Cadre vs **Sect of the Aetheric Conundrum**

Mission: Breach Defenses (Octarius)

Without the fusion device, the Forge has petitioned the Sect for help with overwhelming the Mechanicus stronghold. The Sect charges to breach the walls, but are met with an immediate counterattack by the Hunter Cadre.

### Race for the bomb
Belligerents: The Forge of Days vs **Star Mercs**

Mission: Search and Retrieve (Octarius)

A central fusion core of this district has been lost in the rubble. The Forge wants to convert it to an explosive strong enough to breach the nearby stronghold, but the Corsairs are trying to snatch it first, selling it on to the highest bidder.
