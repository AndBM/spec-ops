### Prelude
For two hours now, he had been stamping gears from plasteel sheets at an inredible rate. His heavy duty gloves were covered with soot on the outside, and soaked in sweat on the inside. His face was as black as his gloves, with streaks of skin showing through the lines formed by salty droplets from his hairline. It was done. His quota had been met, and he would not be reassigned for approximately twenty minutes. He ran. The Wroclavius Witnesses were gathering

It was not easy to get there. That was important. The pipe spacings you needed to squeeze through,the bolts you had to unscrew, these were all protections against the High Lord, or even worse, the inquisition. He arrived in the middle of a sermon. She was speaking, the Witness Mother, the champion of truth, covered in dirt and with eyes glowing from behind the horned battle mask of ritual.

“… and through this, we have been shown the fucking truth. They call our work sacred, a life well spent in service to their God Emperor. Well, they also tell us that there are no other Gods, that there is no such thing as Magik, and that the universe is an uncaring void. But you are all here because you know! You have seen the will of the Gods made manifest. You know the truth, and now you are all responsible for your own fucking freedom! But you do not stand alone, brothers and sisters. All over the planet our fellow workers are waiting to seize control of the plants and overthrow the oppressors! We are the many!”

Cheers rang out through between the metal sheets and pipes of their cramped hideout, but she could see the doubt in their eyes.

“I know. There is no revolution without blood. But remember the martyrdom of Richard A-62! Remember how he, with nothing a pilfered shotgun and unwavering trust in the truth of the eight-fold way, charged one of these so-called angels of death and blasted through his power armor helmet, crushing its superhuman head into a bloody pulp! “ 

A metallic voice rang out.

“Do you think our Gods could look at such an act of faith without granting him their favor? His brave sacrifice paved the way for the liberation of the Ekstrom Manufactorum. So do not despair. Offer your rage to the Aspect of Bravery.”

All bowed their heads as the sermon drew to a close and repeated the words.

“Offer your elation to the Aspect of Passion. Offer your ambition to the Aspect of Magik. And offer your bodies to the Aspect of Life, that this world may be free, and your soul lifted with favor.”

++ Productivity dip of 2.5 points detected. ++

“And before you leave, I have one final piece of news.”

All hesitated. There was no time for this, but her tone of voice had a promise in it. “While I am sure you would all happily follow the path of blessed Richard A-62,” she smirked, “you might not have to. Word has come from the Disciples. It seems we will soon be joined by our own angels of death.”

As the voice rang out, 

++ Productivity dip of 3 points detected. Treacherous levels imminent. ++

He returned to his post. With renewed power he started stamping out gears for his next quota, secretly offering his joy to the Aspect of Passion that freedom was in the air.
